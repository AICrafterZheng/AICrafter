# Agentic Workflows

In contrast to the **non-agentic workflows** where an AI model simply generates a response to a prompt, **agentic workflows** involve a more iterative and self-reflective process. Rather than just producing an output in a single shot, agentic AI agents engage in a series of steps to improve the quality and effectiveness of their work.

Agentic workflows are more similar to how humans approach complex tasks, with phases of research, planning, drafting, reviewing, and revising. This leads to significantly better results compared to the traditional prompt-and-generate approach.

Let's look at an example to illustrate the difference:

**Non-Agentic Workflow**:
- You provide a prompt to the AI, such as "Write an essay on the benefits of renewable energy."
- The AI generates a complete essay in response, without any opportunity for iteration or self-improvement.

**Agentic Workflow**:
<Steps>
### Step 1
You prompt the AI agent to "Create an outline for an essay on the benefits of renewable energy."
### Step 2
The AI agent generates an outline, considering the key points to cover.
### Step 3
You then ask the AI agent to "Research the latest developments and statistics on renewable energy."
### Step 4
The AI agent gathers the relevant information and provides a summary.
### Step 5
You instruct the AI agent to "Write a first draft of the essay using the outline and research."
### Step 6
The AI agent produces the first draft, which you then review.
### Step 7
You ask the AI agent to "Identify areas in the draft that could be improved and revise the essay accordingly."
### Step 8
The AI agent analyzes the draft, makes revisions, and provides an updated version of the essay.
</Steps>

As you can see, the agentic workflow involves multiple steps of planning, research, drafting, and self-reflection, leading to a much more polished and effective end result. This iterative approach is a key characteristic of agentic AI workflows.

By incorporating these agentic design patterns, you can unlock significant performance improvements in your AI applications, potentially surpassing the capabilities of even the latest foundational models.
