# Key Design Patterns in Agentic AI

As Andrew Ng highlighted, there are four key design patterns that are crucial to the effectiveness of agentic AI workflows: **reflection**, **tool use**, **planning**, and **multi-agent collaboration**. These patterns represent powerful techniques that can significantly boost the performance of language models and other AI systems.

Let's dive into each of these design patterns in more detail:

## Reflection

The **reflection** pattern involves the AI agent engaging in self-analysis and self-correction. Rather than simply generating an output and presenting it, the agent reflects on its own work, identifies potential issues or areas for improvement, and iterates to produce a better result.

For example, an AI agent tasked with writing code for a specific problem might first generate an initial solution. It would then review that code, checking for correctness, efficiency, and overall quality. Based on this self-reflection, the agent could identify and fix bugs, optimize the code, or even completely rewrite certain sections. By going through this iterative process, the agent can significantly improve the quality of the final output.

## Tool Use

The **tool use** pattern involves the AI agent leveraging a diverse set of external tools and capabilities to enhance its problem-solving abilities. This could include web search, data analysis, image processing, or even the ability to execute code and test it.

When faced with a complex task, the agent can dynamically identify and utilize the appropriate tools to gather information, perform analyses, and take actions. This expands the agent's overall competence and allows it to tackle a wider range of problems.

For example, an agent tasked with recommending the best coffee maker might first search the web for reviews and ratings, then analyze the features and specifications of various models, and finally provide a personalized recommendation based on the user's preferences.

## Planning

The **planning** pattern enables AI agents to autonomously navigate complex tasks, rerouting around failures and unexpected challenges. By employing advanced planning algorithms, agents can break down problems, anticipate potential obstacles, and devise robust strategies to achieve their objectives.

In one demonstration, an agent was asked to generate an image based on a textual description. The agent was able to recognize that it lacked the necessary capabilities to directly generate the image, so it devised a plan: first, it determined the pose of the person in the image, then it found a model to synthesize the image, and finally it used a text-to-speech model to describe the result.

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

The **multi-agent collaboration** pattern involves the coordination and interaction of multiple AI agents, each with their own specialized capabilities and perspectives. By engaging in structured debates, exchanges of information, and joint problem-solving, these agents can produce more robust and well-rounded solutions.

For instance, in the [ChatDev](https://github.com/Anthropic/chatdev) system, different agents take on the roles of software engineer, product manager, and tester, collaborating to iteratively design and develop a functional software application. The interplay between these diverse agents leads to a more comprehensive and polished final product.

By incorporating these agentic design patterns, AI systems can unlock unprecedented levels of performance, adaptability, and autonomy. As these technologies continue to evolve, we can expect to see increasingly powerful and versatile AI agents that can tackle increasingly complex challenges.
