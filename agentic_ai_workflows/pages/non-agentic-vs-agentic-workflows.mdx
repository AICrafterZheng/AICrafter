# Non-Agentic vs. Agentic Workflows

Most of us are familiar with the traditional **non-agentic workflow** when using large language models (LLMs). This involves providing a prompt and the model generating a single response, much like asking a person to write an essay without any feedback or revisions. 

While this approach can work surprisingly well, **agentic workflows** unlock even more powerful capabilities from LLMs. In an agentic workflow, the AI agent engages in a more **iterative, self-reflective process**, dynamically adjusting its approach based on intermediate results.

The key difference is that agentic workflows allow the AI to think, plan, and refine its outputs, rather than just generating a single response.

To illustrate this, let's consider a **coding task**. In a non-agentic workflow, you might simply prompt the LLM to "write a function that calculates the sum of even-indexed elements in a list of integers." The model would then generate a single code snippet in response.

In contrast, an **agentic workflow** would involve multiple steps:

1. **Prompt the agent to outline the approach**: "Okay, let's break this down. First, we need to iterate through the list and identify the even-indexed elements. Then, we need to sum those elements. Can you provide a high-level outline of how you would approach this?"

2. **Prompt the agent to research and gather information**: "Great, that makes sense. Now, can you research and provide any useful functions or algorithms that could help with this task?"

3. **Prompt the agent to write the first draft**: "Awesome, with that information, please go ahead and write the initial code for this function."

4. **Prompt the agent to review and revise the code**: "Okay, let's take a close look at the code you generated. Are there any issues or ways we could improve it?"

By engaging the AI in this iterative process, you unlock significantly better performance. In fact, [research has shown](https://www.anthropic.com/blog/achieving-human-level-performance-on-coding-tasks-with-large-language-models) that agentic workflows can outperform even the latest and greatest LLMs on certain benchmarks.

The benefits of agentic workflows extend beyond just coding tasks. You can apply similar principles to a wide range of AI-powered applications, from content creation and data analysis to task planning and decision-making. By empowering the AI to think, reflect, and refine its approach, you can achieve far more impressive and reliable results.

So, as you start to incorporate LLMs into your workflows, be sure to explore the power of agentic reasoning. It may just be the key to unlocking the full potential of AI in your organization.
